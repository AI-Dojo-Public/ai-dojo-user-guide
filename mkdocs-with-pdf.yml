  # The PDF documentation uses mkdocs-with-pdf. At least on windows, these cannot be installed easily just by pip.
  # Instead, it requires the following:
  # `pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-material-extensions weasyprint`
  # Install weasyprint https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/stable/first_steps.html
  # On windows, this is:
  # - https://www.msys2.org/#installation (for dll management)
  # - Within msys2 console: `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-pango`
  # - Modification of path to include mingw libraries (e.g., `set PATH=C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\;%PATH%`)
