# AI Dojo

AI-Dojo is a platform which enables rapid prototyping of autonomous cybersecurity agents. It provides an integrated 
platform that aims to achieve multiple goals:

- Lightweight simulation of multi-agent cybersecurity scenarios.
- Integration of different behavioral models for attackers, defender, users, or observers.
- Hybrid-stochastic simulation.
- Rapid prototyping of attack and defense strategies.
- Integration of simulation and emulation (e.g., IDS in the loop).
- Smooth transition of agents into the real world.
- Automated generation of realistic cybersecurity scenarios.
- Support for multi-agent collaboration and communication.

Ai-Dojo integrates multiple [components](tech/components.md) into an [architecture](tech/architecture.md) that supports
quick deployment and extensive customization.

So, either [run your first AI-Dojo instance](user/quickstart.md) and explore what it has to offer, or dig deep into the
[technical documentation](tech/components.md) and build your own specialized solutions.
